## Data

We release LoCoMo, a high-quality evaluation benchmark consisting of *very* long-term conversational data. The benchmark consists of ten conversations. Each conversation is annotated for the **question-answering** and **event-summarization** tasks. Additionally, the dialogs in each conversation can be used for the **multimodal-dialog-generation** task. See statistics of the dataset in the Table below.

The dataset can be found in the ```./data/locomo10.json``` file in this repository. Each sample represents a single conversation and it's corresponding annotations: 
* `sample_id`: identifier for the sample
* `conversation`: 
    * List of sessions (`session_<num>`) and their timestamps (`session_<num>_date_time`). The numbers `<num>` represent the chronological order of the sessions. * It also includes names of the two speakers i.e., `speaker_a` and `speaker_b`. 
    * A *turn* within each *session* contains the name of the `speaker`, the dialog id `dia_id`, and content of the dialog `text`. 
    * If the turn contains images, it also includes a link to the image `img_url`, caption generated by the [BLIP](https://huggingface.co/Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-large) model for the image `blip_caption` and the search query used by the third party module [icrawler](https://icrawler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to retrieve the image.
* `observation` (generated): Observations for each of the sessions in `conversation` (`session_<num>_observation`). See below for the code to regenerate observations. These observations are used as one of the databases for evaluating retrieval-augmented generation i.e., RAG models in our paper.
* `session_summary` (generated): Session-level summaries for each session in `conversation` (`session_<num>_summary`). See below for the code to regenerate session-level summaries. These summaries are also used as one of the databases for evaluating RAG models in our paper.
* `event_summary` (annotated): List of significant events for each speaker within each session in `conversation` (`events_session_<num>`). These are the ground truth annotations for the event summarization task in the LoCoMo dataset.
* `qa` (annotated): Question-answer annotations for the question answering task in the LoCoMo dataset. Each sample contains `question`, `answer`, `category` label and a list of dialog ids that contain the answer i.e., `evidence`, when available.


**Note 1**: This release is a subset of the conversations released previously with our first Arxiv version in March 2024. The initial release contained 50 conversations. We sampled a subset of the data to retain the longest conversations with high-quality annotations and for cost-effective evaluation of closed-source LLMs.

**Note 2**: We do not release the images. However, the web URLs, captions and search queries for the images are included in the dataset.


## Code

Configuration variables like API keys, output directories etc. are set in `scripts/env.sh` and run at the beginning of all other scripts.

### Generate *very* long-term conversations between two LLM-agents with pre-assigned personalities using our LLM-based generative framework
The code to generate conversations is available in `scripts/generate_conversations.sh` and can be run as follows:
```
bash scripts/generate_conversations.sh
```

This code can be run under two settings:
1. Generate conversations between agents assigned with custom personas. To enable this setting, point `--out-dir` to a directory containing the files `agent_a.json` and `agent_b.json`. These files should contain the `name` and `persona_summary` of the speaker represented by the agent. See an example at `data/multimodal_dialog/example`.

```
{
  "name": "Angela",
  "persona_summary": "Angela is a 31 year old woman who works as the manager of a gift shop in Chapel Hill. She curates interesting pieces from local artists and has maintained a beautiful gallery in the form of the gift shop. She also makes her own art sometimes, in the form of oil paintings."
}
```

2. Create personalities using prompts from the MSC dataset. To enable this setting, point `--out-dir` to an empty directory. This will make the script sample a pair of personalities from `data/msc_personas_all.json`.

See `scripts/generate_conversations.py` for details on the various parameters that can be tweaked for generating the conversations. For example, `--num-days` can be changed to specify the temporal span of the conversations.

### Evaluate open-source and closed-source LLMs on the LoCoMo Question Answering Task with the (truncated) conversation as context

* Evaluate OpenAI models
```
bash scripts/evaluate_gpts.sh
```

* Evaluate Anthropic models
```
bash scripts/evaluate_claude.sh
```

* Evaluate Gemini models
```
bash scripts/evaluate_gemini.sh
```

* Evaluate models available on Huggingface
```
bash scripts/evaluate_hf_llm.sh
```

### Generate observations and session summaries from LoCoMo conversations using `gpt-3.5-turbo` for evaluating RAG-based models
We provide the observations and summaries with our release of the LoCoMo dataset. Follow these instructions to re-generate the same or for a different set of conversations.

* Generate observations from all sessions:
```
bash scripts/generate_observations.sh
```

* Generate summary of each session:
```
bash scripts/generate_session_summaries.sh
```
**Note 3**: Session-summaries are different from the event summaries of the event summarization task. The former summairze only a single session whereas event summaries are specific to each speaker and contain causal, temporal connections across sessions.


### Evaluate retrieval-augmented `gpt-3.5-turbo` on the LoCoMo question-answering task using (a) dialogs, (b) observations and (c) session summaries as databases.
* Evaluate `gpt-3.5-turbo` using retrieval-based augmentation
```
bash scripts/evaluate_rag_gpts.sh
```

### Evaluate models on the event summarization task

Coming soon!

### Train and evaluate `MiniGPT-5` models on the multimodal dialog generation task

Coming soon!
